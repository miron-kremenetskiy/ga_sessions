# Approach
First I looked through the sample data, to get an understanding of what was in there and the structure of it.
Then, I took each question one at a time and researched things as I ran into any roadblocks.
For the last question, I dove into the field documentation that was shared in the assessment overview. This helped me understand what I could possibly use and what might help predict purchasing.

# Problems
I think the only problem I encountered was that I'm not very familar with BigQuery so I had to do some research around dealing with arrays.
